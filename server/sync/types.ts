/**
 * Storage adapter interface used by `createSyncServer`.
 *
 * Two adapters ship with BedrockJS:
 *   - `denoKvAdapter()`   — built on Deno.openKv()
 *   - `sqliteAdapter()`   — built on jsr:@db/sqlite
 *
 * Consumers can implement this interface to plug in any database.
 *
 * Conventions:
 *   - All keys are namespaced by (scope, model). `scope` is `''` when the
 *     server has no scope hook configured.
 *   - `appendChange` MUST atomically: write the new row, append to the change
 *     log, and bump the per-(scope,model) cursor.
 *   - `cursor` is a positive integer that monotonically increases per
 *     (scope, model). Clients pass `since=<cursor>` to receive everything
 *     strictly greater than that value.
